# FrameCut Web Editor

FrameCut Web is a high-performance, web-based video editor built with React 19 and Vite. It supports advanced features like multi-track timeline editing, dynamic effects (Zoom, Spotlight, Mosaic), and real-time screen recording with a built-in PiP timer.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended)

### Local Development
1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Setup Environment**:
   Create a `.env.local` file and add your Gemini API key (if using AI features):
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
3. **Run Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a **Centralized State + Pure Rendering** architecture to ensure timeline precision and performance.

- **State Management**: Centralized in `App.tsx` using React hooks. The state includes assets (Intro, Main, Outro, Audio), timeline clips, subtitles, and effect configurations.
- **Rendering Engine**: Located in `components/Player.tsx`. It uses a **RequestAnimationFrame loop** to draw directly onto an HTML5 Canvas. This bypasses React's reconciliation lag for smooth frame-accurate previews and effects.
- **Timeline Engine**: Located in `components/Timeline.tsx`. Focuses on visual representation of clips and drag-and-drop interaction.
- **Utility Layer**: `utils.ts` handles timecode formatting, waveform extraction (Web Audio API), and media metadata fetching.
- **Type System**: Heavily typed in `types.ts` to ensure consistency across the editor's complex data structures.

## ✨ Features

- **Video Editing**: 
  - Manage Intro, Main Video, and Outro assets separately.
  - Frame-accurate clipping and timeline positioning.
  - Multi-source support (URL import or Local file upload).
- **Audio & Waveforms**:
  - Independent background audio track.
  - Real-time waveform generation for visual syncing.
- **Dynamic Effects**:
  - **Zoom**: Smooth interpolation and cropping.
  - **Spotlight**: Focus on specific areas with custom gradients.
  - **Mosaic**: Interactive drawing on the video to blur sensitive content.
- **Subtitles**: Drag-and-drop subtitle positioning with real-time editing.
- **Screen Recording**: 
  - Integrated screen capture.
  - Floating Picture-in-Picture (PiP) timer for recording feedback.
  - Auto-generation of spotlight markers during recording.
- **Export Engine**: Support for canvas-based frame capture and video export (WebM/MP4, subject to CORS).

## 🧪 Testing

We use **Playwright** for end-to-end (E2E) testing to ensure the editor's core features work as expected across different browsers.

### Running Tests

1. **Ensure the Dev Server is Running**:
   In one terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Run All Tests**:
   In another terminal, run:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test
   ```
3. **Run Specific Tests**:
   For example, to run the screen recording test:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test tests/recording.spec.ts
   ```
4. **Debug Tests with UI Mode**:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --ui
   ```

### Test Coverage

Currently, we have automated coverage for:
- **Screen Recording Flow**: Verifies starting a recording, waiting for 5 seconds, stopping, and ensuring the video is correctly loaded into the editor ([recording.spec.ts](file:///Users/weijingliunyu/IdeaProjects/framecut-web/tests/recording.spec.ts)).

### Configuration

Tests are configured in [playwright.config.ts](file:///Users/weijingliunyu/IdeaProjects/framecut-web/playwright.config.ts). This configuration includes:
- **Automatic Media Permissions**: Chromium is configured to use fake media streams and auto-approve screen sharing requests.
- **Base URL**: Defaults to `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel for maximum speed.

## 📦 Deployment

This is a static-site-ready Vite application.

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Static Hosting
The output in the `dist/` directory can be deployed to any static hosting provider:
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Just connect the repo; it will auto-detect Vite.
- **GitHub Pages**: Ensure `base` is correctly set in `vite.config.ts`.
- **AWS S3/CloudFront**: Upload `dist/` contents. Note that media assets must support **CORS** for some features (like Export/Mosaic) to work.
