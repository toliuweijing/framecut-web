# Feature Specification Document: [Feature Name]

## 1. Executive Summary

-   **Feature**: [A clear, concise name for the feature]
-   **Status**: [e.g., Planned, In Progress, Implemented, Deferred]
-   **Summary**: [A brief, one-paragraph summary of the feature. What is it, and what is its primary purpose? This should be understandable by both technical and non-technical stakeholders.]

## 2. Design Philosophy & Guiding Principles
[This section defines the core user experience principles for this feature. It serves as a compass for all subsequent design and implementation decisions. For each principle, select one side of the spectrum or articulate a nuanced position.]
**Clarity vs. Power:**
-   **Guiding Question**: Is the primary goal for this feature to be immediately understandable and simple, or to be feature-rich and powerful for expert users?
-   **Our Principle**: [e.g., "Prioritize clarity above all. A new user should understand it in 5 seconds. We will intentionally omit advanced features to maintain simplicity."]

**Convention vs. Novelty:**
-   **Guiding Question**: Should this feature leverage familiar, industry-standard patterns, or should we introduce a novel interaction to solve the problem in a unique way?
-   **Our Principle**: [e.g., "Adhere strictly to platform conventions. It should feel like a native, predictable part of the system."]

**Guidance vs. Freedom:**
-   **Guiding Question**: How much should we guide the user? Should we provide a highly opinionated, step-by-step workflow, or give them a flexible "sandbox" to work in?
-   **Our Principle**: [e.g., "Provide strong guardrails and a clear 'happy path.' The UI will guide the user to the most common and successful outcome."]

**Forgiveness vs. Strictness:**
-   **Guiding Question**: How do we handle user error? Should the system prevent errors from happening, or make it easy to undo mistakes after they've been made?
-   **Our Principle**: [e.g., "Design for forgiveness. Every critical action will have an 'undo' option. Confirmation dialogs will be used sparingly."]

**Aesthetic & Tone:**
-   **Guiding Question**: What is the emotional goal of this feature? What should the user feel?
-   **Our Principle**: [e.g., "The tone is professional, minimalist, and fast. Animations will be subtle and purposeful." or "The vibe is playful and encouraging. We'll use brighter colors and friendlier microcopy."]

    -   ...

## 5. User Stories

[Describe the feature from the perspective of different user roles. Use the standard "As a..., I want..., so that..." format.]

-   As a **[User Type/Role]**, I want **[to perform an action]** so that **[I can achieve a benefit]**.
-   As a **[Another User Type/Role]**, I want **[to perform an action]** so that **[I can achieve a benefit]**.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

[Define the specific, testable conditions that must be met for the feature to be considered complete. Use the Gherkin (Given/When/Then) syntax for clarity.]

-   **Scenario: [A clear description of the scenario]**
    -   **Given**: [The initial state or precondition]
    -   **When**: [The action performed by the user]
    -   **Then**: [The expected outcome or result]
    -   **And**: [An additional outcome, if necessary]

-   **Scenario: [Another scenario]**
    -   **Given**: ...
    -   **When**: ...
    -   **Then**: ...

## 7. UI/UX Flow & Requirements

-   **User Flow**: [Describe the step-by-step journey the user takes to interact with this feature. This can be a simple numbered list or a more complex flow diagram.]
    1.  User starts at [Screen A].
    2.  User clicks [Button B].
    3.  User is taken to [Screen C] and sees [UI Element D].
-   **Visual Design**: [Link to mockups, wireframes, or prototypes from design tools like Figma, Sketch, etc. If not available, provide a text description of the UI.]
-   **Copywriting**: [List any new user-facing text, such as button labels, titles, error messages, or instructions.]

## 8. Technical Design & Implementation

[This section is typically filled out by the engineering team. It outlines the technical approach.]

-   **High-Level Approach**: [Describe the overall technical strategy. Will new components be created? Will existing ones be modified? Are there any new libraries or APIs involved?]
-   **Component Breakdown**: [List the new or modified components (e.g., React components, backend services).]
    -   `NewComponent.tsx`: ...
    -   `ExistingService.ts`: ...
-   **API Endpoints**: [If applicable, describe any new or changed API endpoints.]
-   **Key Logic**: [Detail any complex algorithms or business logic.]

## 9. Data Management & Schema

[Describe how data is created, stored, accessed, or modified by this feature.]

### 9.1. Data Source

[Where does the data come from? (e.g., User input, API call, local storage)]

### 9.2. Data Schema

[If there is a new or modified data structure, define it here. For example, a JSON object schema.]```json
{
"key": "type",
"description": "A description of the key"
}
```

### 9.3. Persistence

[How and where is the data stored? (e.g., In-memory state, `localStorage`, a remote database).]

## 10. Storage Compatibility Strategy (Critical)

[**Mandatory for this project:** Because we support "Bring Your Own Storage" (Firebase, Google Drive, and Static R2), every feature must be evaluated against all three backends. Use this matrix to define behavior.]

| Feature Aspect | Firebase (Cloud) | Google Drive (BYOS) | Static Mirror (R2) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Data Storage** | Firestore Collection | JSON File (`content/id.json`) | JSON Snapshot |
| **Real-time Sync** | WebSocket (Instant) | Polling (10s delay) | N/A (Manual Publish) |
| **Permissions** | Rules-based (Robust) | File-scoped (Opaque) | Public Read-Only |
| **[New Feature]** | *How it works here* | *How it works here* | *Does it work?* |

*Note: If a feature cannot be supported on a specific provider (e.g., "Search" on Static Mirror), explicitly state the degradation strategy (e.g., "Hide search bar").*

## 11. Limitations & Known Issues

[Be transparent about any trade-offs, constraints, or known issues with the proposed implementation.]

-   **Limitation 1**: [e.g., This feature will not work in older browsers like IE11.]
-   **Known Issue 1**: [e.g., Large datasets may cause performance degradation.]

## 12. Architectural Visuals (Optional)

*[Use this section for features that involve significant architectural changes, data flow refactoring, or complex state transitions. Visuals are invaluable for team alignment and review. Mermaid diagrams are preferred for their clarity and maintainability within Markdown.]*

*[Provide a brief, high-level introduction to the visual comparison, explaining what is being changed and why.]*

### Before: [Name of the Current State/Model]

*[Provide a concise description of the "before" state. What is the current problem or architecture that is being changed?]*

```mermaid
graph TD
